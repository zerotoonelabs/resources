> ### "Power is gained by sharing knowledge, not hoarding it"

**Zero to One Labs** company periodically holds a presentation about various **SWE\** (Software Engineering) topics. We call it **'tech talks'**. **Tech talks\** are short presentations with community question and answer sessions. They are usually under an hour in length and focus on a specific technical topic. Feel free to explore SWE world using our presentations.

If you are going to pitch, please look at [presentation branch](https://github.com/zerotoonelabs/resources/tree/preparation).
